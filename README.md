apparently either people arent computer savy or modders are too dumb to be modding a game console with a printer's cpu.

if you are using anything other than the debug rom thats why it isnt working.
a clean rom isnt required for people implimenting these to their rom modification but is recommended
if your rom has the legend of debug congradulations your rom is sodimized and unusable. get a clean dump.
a clean dump should have a sh1 checksum of 50bebedad9e0f10746a52b07239e47fa6c284d03 and be 512 megabit (64mb)

to apply these mods you have 2 options.
manually or with melonspeedruns ocarina auto injector
the easiest is to put the folders of the mods you wantin ocarina auto injector's files folder putting zelootma.z64 in roms
and double click the exe. if you get an infinite loop error follow these instruction here

specifically the crc correction part.

to do it mannualy use a hex editor, the name is the offset and the file contents is the data to replace the bytes at that spot.
dont make the rom bigger just paste over it. you still need to fix the crc.
